Personal Password Manager 
By Alex Earl and Harrison Tarsia

Concepts
  - Password locked Accounts
  - Key generation from Passwords (using hashes?)
  - Encrypted Passwords (likely AES 128/192bit)
  - Decryption of individual passwords when requested

Passwords (hashes stored to check validity)
Keygen ? (maybe different hash for keygen: has user and password) add another layer of diffusion proprietary system (use mix of data)
